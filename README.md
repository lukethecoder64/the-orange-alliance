# TheOrangeAlliance

[The Orange Alliance](http://theorangealliance.org) is a single page web application (SPA) as well as a public REST API. It was inspired by [The Blue Alliance](http://thebluealliance.com), but we're not affiliated.

This project includes the front-end module of a full-stack web application. For further help on using Angular 4, check out their documentation [here.](https://angular.io/docs)

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.


## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
