      <p>The goal of TOA API is to provide us, and potential outside users a way to query our databases. </p>
      <p>The Base URL for accessing anything related to our API is <a href="http://theorangealliance.org/apiv2">http://theorangealliance.org/apiv2</a></p>
      <h2 style="color: orange">Gaining Access to TOA API</h2>
      <p>In order to gain access to TOA API, you need to first gain access to an API key.  You can apply for an <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/u3E1sMuCNT9UcPmH3" target="_blank">API Key Here</a>. Once you have that key, you must set two custom headers with every GET request. You must set <code>X-Application-Origin</code> to the name of your application. Secondly, you must set <code>X-TOA-Key</code> to your API key. </p>
      <h2 style="color: orange">API Access Levels</h2>
      <p><b>Level 0</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Revoked/not yet approved API key.</li>
        <li>Every request to TOA API with this key will be denied with a 403 status.        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Level 1</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Single-purpose/team API key</li>
        <li>Allowed to request data from TOA API, most routes will be available.</li>
        <li>Every request is tracked and a rate limit of 30 requests/minute is placed.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Level 2</b></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Full developer access/application API key</li>
        <li>Allowed to request data from TOA API</li>
        <li>Every request is tracked, but there is no limit on rates.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2 style="color: orange">TOA Base Information</h2>
      <p>Every URL parameter following the /api/ is considered a separate component (in the project they also have their own routing files). Without the X-Application-Origin and X-TOA-Key headers, TOA API will send a 403 forbidden access response. These are used for tracking.</p>
      <p>Here are the following main components as well as their sub-components:</p>
      <p>(Parameters are in bold and will vary)</p>
      <p>* All data is returned in JSON format</p>
